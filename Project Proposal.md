### Research Question

Research Question - How does money move around in the US?

### Proposal

It is a commonly observed phenomenon for certain regions in the country to see a large influx of people, and conversely other regions witness an outflow. This migration can create a positive feedback loop as is the case with San Francisco Bay Area which has become a hub owing to a massive influx of tech talent and attracts more such talent each year due to this status. Negative feedback loops can occur too, such as the surge in high-earning population in SF raises rent astronomically making it more difficult for the majority of people. Analogous points can be made for areas that see people emigrate, such as areas abandoned by major employers.

Closely linked to the movement of people is the movement of the money that they inherently take with them.  As people move to and from an area, there is a direct impact on the local economy that we would like to explore.  This movement of money across the United States is of key interest to our project. Specifically, we will be looking at a data set obtained from the United States Internal Revenue Service that looks at every county in the U.S. from 1989 to 2016 and lists all the major tax information of that county for that year. Few of these metrics have been listed below:

  - Number of returns (single and joint).
  - Number of exemptions.
  - Number of dependents.
  - Number of returns with deductions.
  - Investment interest paid amount.  

There are approximately 3,000 counties in the U.S, and depending on the year, the IRS will track from around 70 to 150 different tax related indicators per county.  Our goal is to sift through this data over the 27 available years in order to reveal emerging trends, learn how these indicators vary with respect to each other, and determine which patterns might have a causal relationship with the trends are observed. The ultimate goal in doing so would be to predict, based on the data that is relevant as input, which counties in the U.S. are going to be most vulnerable to seeing their wealth shrink, and which can be expected to have an especially prosperous near future.
